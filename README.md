# finger-detection
The scripts are developed using Python 2.7 and OpenCV 3.2.0

## FingersNumberDetector.py
### Usage
1. Run the script by
```
python FingersNumberDetector.py
```
2. Place your hand on the 9 green squares and capture your skin color by pressing *z*.
3. Move the ROI (blue square) if you want.
4. Move your hand away (any moving objects) from the ROI.
5. Capture the background by pressing *b*.
6. Now you can start placing your hand in the ROI.

### Shortcuts

Basically, it is the same thing as FingersNumberDetector.py. The only difference is that CNN is used for counting the number of fingers.

### Usage
Same as above with additional functionality to sample training and testing data.
Remember to create the directories below before using.
```
\dataset\
|-- \train\
|-- \test\
```
